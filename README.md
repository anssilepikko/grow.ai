Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An machine learning algorithm to keep house plants in good healh.


## Background

Diffirent house plants have a diffirent ways to keep them flourishing. Usually all the care a plant needs is light and water but watering may sometimes be tricky as all plants don't like the same amount of water and prefer more infrequent artificial rain.

My AI tries to tackle this by reading the moisture level from the flowerpot which is accomppanied by a feedback system where user evaluates the health of the plant every time watering is done. By collecting data from watering and perceived health, AI can learn when the plant could need water just by measuring the moisture which could help plant owners to maintain their house plants better. Final application could notify user always when the plant needs care.


## How is it used?

The AI is implemented in IOT-like computer attached to a moisture sensor and a feedback panel. Sensor measures dirt's moisture level by intervals from which the device can detect watering and the need for watering due to dehydration. Watering and feedback as data could create a model to optimize watering. After learning the optimized pattern the device could notify when it's time to water the plant to keep it thriving.


## Data sources and AI methods

Moisture, watering intervals and moisture.

The AI could be done by supervised machine learning. The specific plant could have a pre-set watering program as starting point which is then optimized.


## Challenges

Alongside watering a plant needs sunlight, right temperature and nutritious dirt to grow. There are many variables to tackle but starting from one variable which needs most user/plant owner attention could help keeping the plants in good health.


## What next?

The project could eventually be used in large greenhouses to optimize growth considering multiple variables.
